assets/

This folder should contain static assets for the portfolio site.
Place your profile image at `assets/images/profile.jpg` (recommended size: 400x400 or 800x800).

Recommended structure:
- assets/images/profile.jpg  (profile photo)
- assets/images/project-1.jpg
- assets/images/project-2.jpg

If you don't add images, the site will fall back to generated placeholders (picsum.photos).
